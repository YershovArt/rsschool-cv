## About me 

As a graduate of a course in HTML and a basic course in JavaScript, I am actively seeking a job as a front-end developer. I discovered the world of programming about two years ago, and since then, I have been highly motivated and diligently studying front-end development. It would be a pleasure to join a team of motivated individuals and contribute towards achieving great results.

Currently, I work as an accountant. I am an attentive and hardworking employee, skills that I believe will be beneficial in a front-end development role.

## Skills
- HTML 5
- CSS 3
- SCSS
- FIGMA
- basic JavaScript
- basic React

## Code examples 
```js
import { NavLink } from "react-router-dom";

function Main() {
	return (
		<div className="main">
			<div className="main__buttons">
				<a href="/create" className="btn">Create note</a>
				<a href="/note/" className="btn">Watch note</a>
			</div>
			<div className="container__about">

				<p>
					<b>ShareNotes</b> - service for sharing notes. Create a note, send a link to the note, and your friend can view it. After viewing the note will be deleted (or after 15min).
				</p>
